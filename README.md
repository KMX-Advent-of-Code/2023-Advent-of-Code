# 2023-Advent-of-Code

For each day, a new folder will be created for each problem. Please create commit(s) to the main branch with your solutions as a notebook or folder with your solution inside. Also please link any ChatGPT conversations you used to solve the problems.

Please make solution files with an identifier for which contributor made the solution, including your name in some format like `your_name-YYYY-MM-DD`.

Marcos has previously written a [python helper function](https://gist.github.com/astrowonk/fea7294df5a0bb61d8eeb8ab0e68cda7) to download / turn inputs into strings, list. Needs a session cookie to download from the AOC site. Caches to a local file which it'll try first.
